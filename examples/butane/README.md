Butane Example
--------------

This example runs a simple four atom "butane" molecule in the NVE (constant
total energy) and NVT (constant temperature) ensembles with Gromacs. The
purpose of this example is to demonstrate:

1. Basic `model_builder` usage. 

2. How interactions are saved in the topol.top for running simulation.

Usage::
$ python run_butane.py
$ python plot_eng.py
